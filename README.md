Run the ! Start batch file to start the server.

Open any minecraft client below 1.8.9, go to "Multiplayer" then "Direct Contact" and type in "localhost" to connect to the server.

If you don't have owner permissions, type "op yourname" into the server window.

You can give yourself a void crophopper with /givecropper
Placing it in a chunk with a cactus farm will send you a message with the X/Z of the chunk you placed it in along with the amount of cactus in that chunk. The hopper will accumulate cactus over time, and you can right click it to collect cactus.

Running the command "/showChunks" will show you all chunks that there are void crophoppers in along with the amount of cactus eligible to spawn in those chunks.
